### Who is present

* All of the stakeholders

### Tips
* Try not to go into implementation details (rabbit hole)
* Use same vocab as client
* make sure any decions presented to the client are agreed upon internally first
* Be honest about knowledge gaps
* Involve client in agile practices
* Make sure someone takes good notes!!
* Make sure everyone leaves with same understanding
    * map dependencies w/ third parties using tools like [FreeMind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)
    * Restate your understanding of what a client explains using your own words/visuals

## Inception Steps

### 1. Identify

* Identify goals
    * capture all of them, group them
* Identify anti-goals
    * everything that might be important someday but could get in the way of achieving actual goals
    * ex. mobile optimization
* Identify Risks
    * business, technical schedule
    * ex. unknown technologies, changing platforms, immovable milestones
* Identify personas/roles
    * also start to think about workflows 

### 2. Story Mapping
* Pick a color for each persona/role
* For each workflow, create stories
    * If a given workflow looks like it's going to take to long to map out, only do most important stories so that workflow can be described at a lower granularity

### 3. Estimation & Prioritization
* Fibonacci
* Put them in order to make backlog
* PM should lead
* Keep goals/risks in mind when prioritizing
